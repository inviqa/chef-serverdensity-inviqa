# serverdensity-inviqa

This cookbook provides additional Server Density configuration not handled by the official cookbook.

## Usage

In its most basic form, this cookbook provides a wrapper for the serverdensity cookbook's install method that includes by default an option to tag servers. It includes one tag as standard, which tags servers as having been provisioned by Chef.
